# Camper Cafe Project

Welcome to the Camper Cafe project! This is my first project, which I've completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I created a simple web page for a fictional cafe showcasing its menu. The project includes information about coffee and desserts along with prices.

## Project Overview

The project is a static HTML webpage styled with CSS. It features a menu divided into two sections: Coffee and Desserts. Each section contains items with their respective prices and images.
